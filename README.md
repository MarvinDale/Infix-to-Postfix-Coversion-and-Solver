# Infix-to-Postfix-Coversion-and-Solver
This assignment has three main problems to be solved. The first problem is reading in and
verifying the validity of the user inputted infix statement. The statement can only contain
single digit numbers and a specific set of characters used as operators.
The second problem is the conversion of the infix statement into the postfix expression. This
must be done using the stack class provided on blackboard.
The third problem is the evaluation of the postfix expression. Since the Stack class provided
stores objects these objects must be cast to a different data type for evaluation.
